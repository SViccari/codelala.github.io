I love finding ways to use left overs!! I was inspired by a delicious root vegetable hummus wrap I ordered at a local cafe the other day, and decided what a great way to use up the remaining root vegetables I made the other day!

Ta da! It came out so yummy and beautiful, I just had to do a little photo shoot to show it off. I added a side of my favorite Root Vegetable chips from Trader Joe's (which, by the way, are heavenly when dipped into the hummus as a snack.)

<strong>Roasted Root Vegetable and Hummus Wrap</strong>

Ingredients:
roasted root vegetables (any type of potato, rutabega, turnips, carrots, etc)
any kind of fresh market greens ( I used mustard greens)
plain hummus
whole wheat tortilla

Directions:
1. Spread a few tablespoons of hummus onto the tortilla
2. Add a layer of greens above the hummus
3. Scoop some of the pre-heated roasted vegetables on top of the layered greens
4. Fold the bottom, then roll from one side to the other to make an open ended wrap. Voila!
