Dear Readers, I would like to share with you my experience visiting Tsukiji Fish Market during my first trip to Japan some years ago mainly because I want to document the experience in writing, which this blog so advantageously allows me to do.

I find it fitting to share with you the email I sent to a friend about my experience since it was most fresh in my head at the time:
<blockquote>Last night, my friend's father took us to be served by an amazing sushi chef, one of the best in Tokyo! Her father is a well known architect and a good friend ‪to‬ the chef. It was a quaint, intimate little sushi restaurant walking distance from ‪her home‬, ‪one of the only vintage Japense-style homes left in ‬a ritzy part of Tokyo ‪called Denenchofu.‪ ‬There ‪was‬ no menu‪, t‬he chef serves you whatever he feels like‪, t‬he sushi was arranged on large tea leaves‪, and our Sake cups were kept full the entire time. ‬

‪The sushi tasted amazing‬! As we continue‪d‬ to eat, the sushi he prepared for us became more and more obscure‪. I tried‬ everything, ‪uttering‬ "<a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/oishii">Oishii, oishii</a>" after every bite‪. I‬t was truly delicious. The chef was impressed by my ungrudging ability to try everything he made, no matter how strange, so he told my friends he was determined to make me something I would absolutely refuse to try. Be‬fore I could discern his plan, out comes this giant <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/11/dining/blood-clams-worth-a-second-look.html">Blood Clam</a>. I had no idea what it was and had never seen anything like it before. He took a huge knife, pried‬ it open, and out spill‪ed‬ a tremendous amount of red...well, blood I assumed! He quickly chopped it up, dresse‪d‬ it, slap‪ped‬ it over rice, and serv‪ed‬ it to me, anxiously awaiting what I would decide to do. Mind you, I had enough sake rolling through my veins to liberate any fettered predispositions on the matter, so I immediately tr‪ied it without hesitation, and to my own parallel surprise...I loved it! It was unlike anything I had ever tasted! So clean and complex, yet delicate on the tongue. Simply delicious.

Well, I must have charmed the pants off the chef because he gave me all these cute little <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omiyage">omiyage</a> and invited my friends and I to tag along with him to the famous Tsukiji Fish Market early next morning to see how he picks the fish for his restaurant‪!‬

We woke up at 5am, met the sushi chef in front of the local train station and rode with him to the market. Upon arrival, we briskly trailed behind him into to the hustle and bustle of the market, curious to see how he picks and buys his fish for sushi making each day. Tourists are not allowed into the market that early but because we were with him, he was able to take us to areas of the market that only chefs or certain people had access to. His rapport with the local fishmongers is so well established, he can get whatever he wants, anytime he wants it, and they send it directly to his restaurant! We were allowed to sample different types of fish as we made our way through the market, some were cut fresh from fish still moving and breathing on the ice! He also bought us little gifts and treats along the way. Although, I spoke very little Japanese, my friends translated for me anytime I had questions, which were hard to squeeze in since he moved so fast! For an old man, I could barely keep up with him! He's an inspiration!

‪After the market, he treated us to a traditional breakfast at a local spot in the fish market that only chefs and professionals knew about. While tourist and local Japanese were waiting in long lines to get fresh sashimi outside of the market, he took us right in to eat at his favorite spot! The whole experience felt like something straight from The Food Channel! I'll never forget it.
