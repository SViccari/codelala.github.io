![Frizzy Curly Hair](http://www.corinaoffthemat.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/how_to_calm_frizzy_curly_hair77.jpg) I am utterly flabbergasted at the recent criticisms by African-American women directed toward Olympic Gymnast Gabby Douglas regarding the way her hair looks during her athletic performances, remarking how she is "not representing black people" well because her hair doesn't look "kept up". Look, I know us black women are finicky when it comes to our hair, but I'm sorry, is being the first ever African-American woman to earn the women's gymnastics all-around title not a good enough representation? Have you seen _anyone's_ hair after they've sweated buckets during an intense workout? I am amazed female gymnasts can keep their hair as tidy as they do, straight or curly. I can't even run up a flight of stairs without looking like Diana Ross took a shower with her finger stuck in a toaster! What was that? Today's humidity just went up 5 degrees? Great, time to grab a stocking cap.

I have thick curly hair or "bi-racial" hair to be exact. It curls tighter in some parts due to my African-American roots and at the same time waves into a looser curl everywhere else due to my Hispanic heritage. ![Static Electricity](http://www.corinaoffthemat.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/funny-static-electricity-hair1-210x300.jpg)It is quite an unruly combination for which the cultural laws that govern how best my hair is to be handled, cut, or styled do not apply. My hair has a mind of its own. And when I sweat, well, then my hair just gets angry. I can't begin to tell you how many times I have walked out of a yoga studio looking like I've had my hands on a static electricity ball for an hour and a half. I am not alone. Most everyone experiences "yoga hair" at the end of a challenging physical practice or workout, leaving ourselves astonished at the atrocities bestowed upon our manes. A_nyone_ who ends a yoga class looking like a million bucks was either not working hard enough or spent the entire time in Shavasana resting their head on a silk pillow while angels brushed their hair with bristles made of gold.

My point is, If I had to worry about what every little strand of hair on my head looked like during an athletic performance or while focusing intensely on trying to nail an arm balance, it would drive me insane. And insanity isn't something our Olympic Gymnast, or any other Olympic athlete for that matter, should have to deal with while making history. It's just hair. Get over it.
