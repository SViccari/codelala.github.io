I decided to cook stuffed cabbage with lovely purple and green cabbage leaves. So, my boyfriend called up his dad for a family recipe (which we usually do for almost any new recipe we want to try out) handed down from his grandmother from Japan. This recipe calls for both pork and beef but given that we only had beef and we are on a budget we opted to leave that ingredient out. According to my boyfriend's father, if you don't use pork you can substitute it with butter. Sold. On to the recipe....

<strong>Grandma Aoi's Stuffed Cabbage</strong>
Prep time: 5 min
Cook time: 30 min

Ingredients:
8 large cabbage leaves
6 tbsp Mirin (sweet cooking sake)
5 tbsp soy sauce
2 cups water
1 lb ground beef 80/20
1 onion
2 tbsp butter
organic ketchup
toothpicks

Steps:
1. Prepare vegetables: Chop onion. Rinse cabbage leaves and trim off excess stalks.Place aside.Note: If the cabbage leafs seem a bit too stiff to roll, you may want to blanch the leaves in boiling water for 2 min then rinse in cold water to soften them.

2. Place 1lb ground beef into a medium to large bowl. Add chopped onion. Begin mixing onion into the meat by folding the meat over itself and mixing it together with your hands. Place this mixture aside.

3. In a deep, flat pan add soy sauce, mirin(cooking sake), and water. Bring to a simmer on medium-low heat.

4. While the sauce is simmering, flatten out a single cabbage onto a cutting board with the stem running from left to right, and drop 3 tbsp of the meat mixture into the center of the cabbage. Fold in the left and right sides, then fold the bottom side in and roll it up towards the top side like you would a classic Mexican burrito. You have creative flexibility here so fold it however you like, but just make sure you secure it underneath with a toothpick. Repeat this for each remaining cabbage leaf. Note: depending on the size of each cabbage leaf you may need to use more or less meat mixture. The trick is to not make them too bulky.

5. Drop each cabbage roll into the simmering sauce and cook for 30 min. Turn them over at the 15 min mark and add butter.

6. Once the butter has melted through, swirl catchup over the top of all the cabbage rolls. I know, ketchup, crazy right? But trust me...this is the key ingredient. It will taste so good!! And who doesn't have ketchup lying around in the fridge begging to be used in a more sophisticated manner other than hamburgers, hotdogs, and fries!

WRAP-UP: We ate this dish with Roasted Potatoes but we think it would have tasted better with steamed white rice. I feel this would have also been paired nicely with a glass of Chardonney but Mikio thought it would have been best with a crisp beer like Asahi.

Let me know about your experience making and eating this dish. Comments are always welcome.
