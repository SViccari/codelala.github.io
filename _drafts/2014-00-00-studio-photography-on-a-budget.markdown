Since I love to experiment with photography I thought I would share with you some of my experimentation where I attempted to recreate a minimalist studio setup with the least amount of equipment. It may come in handy when you are on a tight budget or traveling and need a quick studio setup to photograph simple stills of food, products, crafts, ect.

What you will need:

<ul>
  <li>a large window letting in as much natural daylight as possible</li>
  <li>2-3 white poster boards (you can buy this at any office or art supply store)</li>
  <li>tripod and camera</li>
  <li>table</li>
  <li>maximum strength glue (E600, etc.)</li>
</ul>

First, I placed one white board on the table top and then propped the other white board at a 90Â° angle behind it. You can either place a sturdy vase behind the vertical board to prop it upright or glue the two boards together along the ajoining side (use a very strong construction glue for this, E600 or a glue gun should do the trick).

Make sure the light from your main window is coming in from the left or right side of the table depending on which direction you prefer to light the subject. In my setup above, the window is to the left of the subject. Optionally, you may prop another white board on the opposite side of your main window light source for additional light reflection.
Set up the tripod, camera, and set the white balance to daylight. Arrange your subject onto the base white board as you lik it. Now, snap away.

Remove any distracting elements in the room that sit behind you and your camera so as not to reflect them back into the shot if you are photographing an item with a reflective surface (sush as dishes, cups, etc). You can also utilize soft boxes on the left and right side of the camera to diminish this reflection. That would cost you quite a bit extra, and the point of this tutorial is to demonstrate a simple set up when you are on a budget or just want to experiment.

Feel free to comment and share your example photos demonstrating this concept!
