![$(KGrHqRHJFMFEUZEm2Q2BRFONzlGsg~~60_35-1](http://corinaoffthemat.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/KGrHqRHJFMFEUZEm2Q2BRFONzlGsg60_35-1.jpg)Every Halloween there is a mumbled consensus of annoyance towards the ubiquitous and un-original slutty "fill in the blank" costume. But who is ANYONE to judge this choice in All Hallow's Eve attire? Sure, women who dress up this way are giving in to sexist gender role stereotypes (e.g. slutty maid) that so many women have fought like hell (and are still fighting) for decades to overcome but why not? It's HALLOWEEN!!!

Halloween is a time where we can "exorcise" hidden parts of ourselves or reflect on the darker sides of humanity. Halloween is THE holiday we should be allowed to be ANYTHING we want to be free of judgment, regardless of who we are every other 364 days of the year. Why not be a slutty ANYTHING for Halloween and get creative (a slutty Pumpkin?)

So, the next time you see someone dressed as a slutty whatever and you feel the need to judge her (or him?), don't. Instead, celebrate his or her willingness to have the balls to expose mankind's perverted nature and not care about what anyone thinks. You never know, she or he just might be a really good mom or dad, a teacher, or a scientist working on a cure that will save the world.
