Ah, the Fall Cleanse. What is it and what exactly are we "cleaning"? Why do this for the Fall? We have to drink a tonic of _WHAT_ every morning?! Side effects may include constipation, fatigue, and cravings?!

Those were just a few of the many questions posed on the first session that kicked-off a seven day cleanse  I decided to do with a [friend](http://yoga.maathiildee.com/) of mine this week. How does the saying go? Adventures are better with friends? Or was it misery loves company, I forget.

Quite a few people showed up to the session which was encouraging, but there was only one other duo who seemingly decided to use the buddy system and take on this cleansing adventure together, Thelma & Louise style. This surprised me. Will it be even harder for those doing the cleanse without a friend? Will they have loved ones standing by, ready to lend their support, like a trainer waiting on the sidelines of the ring during a boxing match? I hope so!

Our teacher, [Daniel](http://www.maxsenseofself.com/maxsenseofSelf/Welcome.html), shared with us an interesting observation about the Fall: it's a season where all of the nature around us begins to slow down to prepare for the coming Winter. Yet, as humans, we don't always abide by these seasonal shifts. Instead, we continue to move through our lives at the same rapid pace, withstand the same daily assaults to our senses, indulge in the same bad habits, reeking havoc on our nervous and digestive system [simultaneously](http://www.theverge.com/2013/8/21/4595712/gut-feelings-the-future-of-psychiatry-may-be-inside-your-stomach) causing an imbalance. But by eliminating sugars, stimulants, foods that are not easily broken down and opting to eat whole, unprocessed foods we can reset our liver, gut and mind so they can do their jobs more efficiently while we transition into a new season as the leaves begin to fall and the air begins to cool.

Another interesting point about our digestive system: if you think you are pretty regular but drink coffee every morning, you may be in for a rude surprise once it is removed from your diet. In order to get a clear picture of the state of one's digestive health, it is helpful to remove outside stimulants to get a baseline of how your body deals with removing waste on its own, without the help of Mr. Joe. I stopped drinking caffeine yesterday to get a head start as I was more afraid of being fatigued and moody with a headache all day due to withdrawal than I was sitting in the bathroom for a long time. So far so good!

So, we'll see how this goes. The low points, the high points, the "wtf is going on with my body and my mind" points...it's all part of the adventure towards getting my self seven days closer to a more enjoyable transition into Fall, my favorite season of the year.
