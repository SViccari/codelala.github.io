![Sculpture](http://corinaoffthemat.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/IMG_1359.jpeg) Diving "third-eye" first into the book [_The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali_
](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1938477073/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&

7073) during my first philosophical discussion at Yoga Teacher
Training turned out to be a lot like how I imagine the addicts on that
show _Intervent__ion_ must feel once they discover the "interview"
they thought they were attending is in actuality an intervention, only
I'm the one who invited myself to the interview, I'm the one asking
all the questions, and I'm the one responsible for my own treatment.

What I expected to hear during the discussion was a lot of talk about
how Yoga is a "spiritual journey to find the light within me" or to be
a true Yogi I must first discover my "authentic self". You know,
something akin to the usual ineffective style of banter loved ones say
to an addict in order to hopelessly convince them they need help. What
I didn't expect was how quickly the Sutras made me become conscious of
the fact that my current attitude towards life's obstacles was leaving
me entangled in a web of anxiety, unfulfilled relationships, and
dissatisfaction with my present station in life. The secular tactics I
was using on a daily basis to face my fears, accomplish goals, and
improve myself were just not working.

I had indeed hit spiritual rock bottom. I had become the negative
chatter that surrounds me, like a prism of glass taking on the color
of whatever gets near it or a plaster mold encasing me into a muddled
copy of my true self. That's when I realized, _I really need this_. It's time to break free.
