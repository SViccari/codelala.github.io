![Skinny Bitch Fat Bitch](http://corinaoffthemat.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/skinny-bitch-fit-bitch.jpg) I hopped on the scale during a doctors appointment the other day and to my surprise I lost SIX solid pounds since the beginning of the year! Three of those pounds most likely slid off after I started riding my bike to get around the city while simultaneously cutting back on my latte indulgences. It just goes to show, it's the little things that make a HUGE difference.

Let me be clear: I don't believe anyone should aim to lose weight just to be skinny. In my honest opinion, being skinny when its not the way you look naturally is unattractive, not to mention unhealthy. There's a reason for the term "skinny bitch". Wouldn't you be in a bitchy mood all the time if you were starving yourself to stay thin? Why ruin your body trying to look like [Kate Moss](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate_Moss) when you can strive to look superhero-chic like [Lolo Jones](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lolo_Jones)? Granted, you would probably have to quit your job, workout full-time, and ditch the lattes to look like a world class Olympian, but it's a much more thriving body image to aspire to.

>"You can't be fat and mean Andrea. If you're going to dish it out you've got to be able to lick it up. Fat people are jolly for a reason. Fat repels people, but joy attracts them. Now, I know everybody's laughing at your cruel jokes, but nobody's inviting you to the prom. You can either be fat and jolly or a skinny bitch, it's up to you." - The Big C

![](http://corinaoffthemat.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/images.jpg)Being FIT, doesn't mean being skinny. It means being STRONG, HEALTHY, and HAPPY, and that can mean different things for different people. Being fit means taking your genetics and showing them who's boss by accepting what you were born with and improving what you've got RIGHT NOW. If that means skinny, fine. If that means big, then that's fine too. Rather than focus on the negatives, put a positive spin on those traits and work towards realistic goals. I was born with a big booty, bad knees, and big hair. Instead, I say I have a STRONG butt that sustain me in yoga class, sensitive knees that remind me to slow down and move with INTEGRITY, and hair that makes me culturally UNIQUE and a stand out in the crowd. You are given only one body in life. Work the one you got right now.

I aim to be a "fit bitch". Are you with me?
