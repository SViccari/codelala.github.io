![Art by Melissa Sherbon](http://www.corinaoffthemat.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/breathe-melissa-sherbon-240x300.jpg) Alright, I know the title of this post sounds a little bit like a bad late-
night infomercial for a high-tech asthma inhaler, but just bare with me on
this one. On Monday, I went for a 3 mile run! My first run in a year to be
exact. I know all you "real" runners out there are probably laughing your
little fit booties off saying, "Only 3 miles? That's nothing! I run three
miles just to grab a cup of coffee in the morning!" But hey, we all have to
start somewhere, right?

Sure, I do a lot of yoga, but that doesn't get my heart pumping in the same
way good old-fashioned cardio can. And I'm NOT talking about the 2 min walk to
the Starbucks near my apartment. I'm talking the "my thighs are burning and I
forgot my last name" kind of cardio.

To say the run felt good physically would be a lie. After mile one, the whole
left side of my body and I were definitely having a "conversation". Every muscle in my
body was screaming, "What the hell are you doing! Haven't we worked hard
enough twisting you into variations of Half Lotus or sustaining your balance
in Warrior III? Now, you want to get all '[Chariots Of
Fire](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-7Vu7cqB20)' on us?"

"No Pain, No Gain‚Äù aside, a few minutes into my run my heart rate began to elevate and breathing became more and more difficult, sending me into that
all too familiar panic: that feeling that somehow you might actually stop
breathing, suffocate, and die right there on the spot. Ok, its a ridiculous notion to think you are going to die just from some heavy breathing. If you are over the
age of 75 or have a medical condition barring you from any kind of physical
exertion, then it might be possible to die from heaving breathing, unless
you're [this guy](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1If8RCTUIQs), in which case God is obviously on your side.

So, instead of surrendering myself to the panic, I kicked into a breathing
technique practiced in yoga called [Ujjayi
breath](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ujjayi_breath), a slow and steady ocean-
like breath that flows in through the nose and generally back out of your
nose again, sort of what a peaceful Darth Vader (thank you for this simile [Goldie!](http://goldieyoga.com/)) would probably sound like if
he were sleeping and dreaming of kittens. My breathing became steady and the
panic subsided, allowing me to relax and enjoy the rest of my run. And I owe
it all to yoga. Pretty cool, if you ask me.
