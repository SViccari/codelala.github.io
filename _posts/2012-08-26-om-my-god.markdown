![](http://www.corinaoffthemat.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/yoga_class-300x264.jpg)Every time I chant Om at the end of a yoga class it goes a little something like this: "Oooooooooo" ... am I too loud? ... "oooooooooo" ... I am definitely louder than the girl next to me ... "oooooooooo" ... my pitch sounds a little high, maybe I should make it lower ... "oooooommmm" ... how long am I supposed to hold this? ... "mmmmmmmmmm" ... sounds like some guy in the back is deciding to finish this ... "mmmmmmmmmm". Namaste.

I'm pretty sure this type of self-analytical sensitivity to auditory cues from others is how an entire room of blissful yogis can chant a single Om in perfect unison. So, you can imagine it came to quite a surprise at the end of a recent yoga practice when suddenly someone decided to challenge this social construct by branching off into their own chant, raising her voice louder and louder until it reached a high-pitched scream. It sounded like the undead trying to claw its way out of the grave! It was very unpleasant.

Being the respectful yogis that we were, no one in the room said a single word, but you could feel the tension as everyone's bodies seized up in confusion, waiting for this person to finish their own personal little yoga session. Looking around, "AWKWARD" was written all over everyone's face, and inside my own head I was laughing like a Hyena. I tend to react this way when things become extremely weird, socially speaking.

Puzzled by this person, I wondered, was she not aware of how group dynamics are _suppposed_ to work? Had she ever sung a group song when she was a kid? Had she maybe learned a different way to Om that none of us were aware of? I Googled various ways of chanting Om and found nothing like what I heard bellow from within the depths of this woman's vocal chords. Could some Feux-Guru dressed in white and gold chains taught her something incorrect just to make a quick buck? We may never know.

So she didn't chant like everyone else, who cares? Why should that cause such an awkward stir? Her chanting certainly didn't hurt anyone, although, I'm pretty certain every dog within a mile radius is now deaf and traumatized forever. What I really find more interesting is how quickly we respond to displays of non-conformity within a group setting when the majority has assumed through collective experience how things "should be done". We all strive to be different, but we have to accept there are just some things we subconsciously agree to do the same for the sake of unity. And chanting Om in a room full of people is definitely one of them.
