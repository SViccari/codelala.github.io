When you're new to coding the web, it can be overwhelming. There are so many tools, languages, plugins, frameworks, terminologies, resources, and documentation, it's easy to get overwhelmed. I know I certainly did.

There are two setup guides that I often refer to when getting a computer **"code ready"**, they are: [Mac Dev Setup](https://github.com/nicolashery/mac-dev-setup) by Nicolas Hery and [Install How-to](http://www.moncefbelyamani.com/how-to-install-xcode-homebrew-git-rvm-ruby-on-mac/) by Moncef Belyamani. Both provide an exhaustive list of everything you need to get up-and-running on any Apple MAC OSX system but the entire list can be very overwhelming for a someone new to coding and the majority of tools you won't need until you become a more experienced programmer.

To help navigate these torrid installation waters as a newbie coder, I created a straightforward setup guide that walks you through everything you will need to get started coding for the web. It is divided into two categories: *Basic Setup* and *Enhancements*. The [Basic Setup](#basic-setup) guides you through the essential tools, applications, and resources you will need to get coding right away. [Enhancements](#enhancements) are the "extras", plugins and configurations that I personally like to use to enhance my personal development workflow and make it more efficient.

<i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle fa-lg alarm"></i> *I suggest you complete the <strong>Homework</strong> section at the end of each installation step (indicated by the <i class="fa fa-coffee"></i> symbol) before proceeding to the next step as some of the knowledge gained is useful in understanding the the next installation process.*

Let's get started shall we?

<h3 id="system-update">System Update</h3>

<i class="fa fa-lightbulb-o fa-lg"></i> ***Why?*** 

Many of the tools you will install for coding and development are constantly being updated based on the latest operating system. To avoid a headache and broken installs down the road its a good idea to update your computer's operating system to the latest version any time you install something new to ensure a fresh and clean starting point. 

<i class="fa fa-download fa-lg"></i> ***How?***

- Click on the **Apple Icon** located in the upper left corner of your screen's menu bar
- In the drop-down menu, select **Software Updateâ€¦** which will open a new window listing any available updates
- If there updates to be installed, click the **Update** or **Update All** button and wait until all updates are complete before proceeding

<h3 id="system-info">Get To Know Your System</h3>

<i class="fa fa-lightbulb-o fa-lg"></i> ***Why?***

When installing tools onto your computer, it's useful to know exactly which operating system version you are currently running so you know which version of a tool is compatible with your system for download. Have this information handy to use later in this guide. 

<i class="fa fa-download fa-lg"></i> ***How?***

- Click on the **Apple Icon** located in the upper left corner of your screen's menu bar
- In the drop-down menu, select **About this Mac** which will open a new smaller window
-  Your current OS X version is listed just underneath the Apple icon.
- Note that you can also update your system from here by clicking on the **Software Update** button located just underneath the operating system version details but since we already updated our system in the previous section we're ready to continue

<i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle fa-lg alarm"></i> To use this guide effectively you must have the latest Apple Mac OS X operating system installed which currently is OS X 10.9 Mavericks, although if you have OS X 10.8 Mountian Lion that will be fine. 

<h3 id="internet-browser">Internet Browser</h3>

<i class="fa fa-lightbulb-o fa-lg"></i> ***Why?***

In order to test how your web project will look and function you will need an Internet Browser. Most computers come pre-installed with one, for example Safari on Apple Mac computers but if you don't have one you will need to install it.

Most Professional Web Developers prefer to use [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) or [Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/) because they have the most useful debugging tools and plugins which help make developing for the web more efficient. My personal preference is Chrome, so that is what we will be installing in this guide.

<i class="fa fa-download fa-lg"></i> ***How?***

- Visit [https://www.google.com/chrome/](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/)
- Click the **Download** button and download the **.dmg** file to your desktop.
- Once the file has finished downloading, open the file and drag and drop the **Google Chrome** app icon into the **Applications** folder
- Open a **Finder** window and under **Devices** click on the the small "eject" icon next to the Chrome install disk image to unmount it. 

<h3 id="code-editor">Code Editor</h3>

<i class="fa fa-lightbulb-o fa-lg"></i> ***Why?***

Like a fellow coder gal described it, *"a code editor is like Microsoft Word but for code."* It's where you will create, edit, and browse your code files as part of your development project. It can check for syntax errors in your code, highlight particular parts of your code to make it easier to read, and suggest code markup as you type to make your coding experience more efficient.

The most popular editors are [Text Mate](http://macromates.com/), [Text Wrangler](http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/), and [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/). Many hardcore developers are dedicated aficionados of [Vim](http://www.vim.org/), a pre-installed editor that runs within the CLI because it allows you to work much faster than you would in any editor application but mastering Vim takes A LOT of practice and CLI knowledge before you can become comfortable using it. I provide links to useful tutorials at the end of this section if you would like to learn more about how to use Vim.

The most popular choice among developers in the coding community and my personal preference is [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) so that is what we will install as part of this guide.

<i class="fa fa-download fa-lg"></i> ***How?***

- Visit [http://www.sublimetext.com](http://www.sublimetext.com/2)
- Click the **OS X** link and download the **.dmg** file to your desktop
- Once the file has finished downloading, open the file and drag and drop the **Sublime Text** app icon into the **Applications** folder
- Open a **Finder** window and under **Devices** click on the the small "eject" icon next to the Sublime Text install disk image to unmount it

<h3 id="command-line-interface">Command Line Interface (CLI)</h3>

<i class="fa fa-lightbulb-o fa-lg"></i> ***Why?***

The Command Line Interface (CLI), also known as the "console" or "terminal" window, is a tool that allows you to quickly interact with your entire computer system on the fly. It can be intimidating at first if you have never used it before, but trust me when I say, with a little practice, it will become your best friend in the wonderful wide world of web development. Try saying *that* ten times in a row in one breath!

All computers come with a default terminal window application but they are a little boring. Let's install a better one with features that make your work in the terminal more enjoyable. I like to use [iTerm2](http://www.iterm2.com/#/section/downloads).

<i class="fa fa-download fa-lg"></i> ***How?***

- Visit [http://www.iterm2.com](http://www.iterm2.com/#/section/downloads)
- Click the **Stable Releases** click the download link and download the **.dmg** file to your desktop.
- Once the file has finished downloading, open the file and drag and drop the **iTerm2** app icon into the **Applications** folder
- Open a **Finder** window and under **Devices** click on the the small "eject" icon next to the iTerm2 install disk image to unmount it.

<i class="fa fa-coffee fa-lg"></i> **Homework**

I suggest you take the time sooner rather than letter to complete Zed. A. Shaw's [The Command Line Crash Course](http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/). As your development experience grows, the more comfortable you are using the CLI the easier it will be to install and work with more advanced tools in the future.

<h3 id="homebrew">Homebrew</h3>

<i class="fa fa-lightbulb-o fa-lg"></i> ***Why?***

Web Developers use many different programming laguages to code the web. Most programming languages come with special code libraries all "packaged" up and ready for use as installable code to help you efficiently accomplish common and useful tasks in your project.
 
> Packages are installable bundles of source code. [[Skvorc](http://computers.tutsplus.com/tutorials/homebrew-demystified-os-xs-ultimate-package-manager--mac-44884)]

As a developer you will eventually use so many of these code libraries in fact, it becomes challenging to keep track of installing, updating, managing, and configuring all of them on a consistent basis. Once package versions become incompatible with one another it can be a real drag trying to figure out where it all went wrong.

Enter [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/), a package manager that wrangles all of the updates and configurations for you! 

Our main concern for installing Homebrew as part of this guide is because it makes it so much easier to install Git for Github which we wil install in our next section, so don't spend to much time worrying about it. It's a useful tool that will become essential to your web development workflow as you become a more experienced coder so its good practice to install and start using it now.

<i class="fa fa-download fa-lg"></i> ***How?***

1. In order for Homebrew to work we must have **Command Line Tools** installed which is part of **Xcode** but can be installed independently:
	- Visit <http://developer.apple.com/downloads>
	- Sign in with your Apple ID (the same one you use for iTunes and app purchases)
	- Accept the agreeement and fill out the questionaire to the best of your ability and click the **Register** button
	- In the search box, search for "Command Line Tools"
	- In the resuls list, click on the download link for the version that is appropriate for you operating system.

<h3 id="git-github">Git & Github</h3>

<i class="fa fa-lightbulb-o fa-lg"></i> ***Why?***

[Github](http://www.github.com) is a hosting, code sharing, and social website for the code community. Your profile on Github provides a public (or private if you choose) view to your code projects and can even serve as a portfolio or resume, showing off your awesome coding skills, apps, and contributions to potential employers.

At the heart of GitHub is an open source version control system (VCS) called Git which allows you to keep track of various changes in your code, back up your code to a remote location, and share code between team members or other developers you wish to collaborate with via the Github website. Git is a powerful tool and there can be quite a learning curve to mastering Git's full capabilities but like learning the command line interface, it just takes a bit of practice.

Since this post serves only as a quick reference guide, I have provided useful tutorial links as homework at the end of this section that walk you through the basics of learning Git once you have it installed.

<i class="fa fa-download fa-lg"></i> ***How?***

1. First, create an account on Github by visiting <https://github.com/>, fill out the fields for username, email, and password, and hit the **Sign up for Github** button. You are now part of the Github community!
2. Next, intall Git on your machine. There are a few different ways to do this but find it much easier to install Git and many other development tools with Homebrew
