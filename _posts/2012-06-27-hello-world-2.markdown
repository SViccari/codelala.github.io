![](http://www.corinaoffthemat.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/buddha-300x246.jpg)I do a lot_ _of yoga. But what does it mean to "do" yoga? I show up to the yoga studio, roll out my funky-smelling mat, twist, bend, breath, hold, and sweat my way to a fitter, more booty-licious me. But what does yoga DO for ME?  It's time to stop going through the motions and start "practicing" yoga.  Ok, I know what you are thinking, "Ugh, she's gonna start getting all transcendental guru on us and leave posts that say nothing but 'namaste' repeated like a gazillion times."  On the contrary! I don't really take myself _that_ seriously. Well, at least not now anyways. So, I invite you to become innocent hitchhikers I pick up along the road towards discovering what it _really_ means to have a consistent yoga practice.  Don't worry, it won't be ALL wheat grass shots and contorted poses that make you speak French all of a sudden.  This blog serves as a space where I can practice my writing skills, journal my experience completing an upcoming 200-hr Yoga Teacher Training, and share with you all the things I love do when I am not on my yoga mat and out conquering the world. And if any of my rants help you in some small way, then that would be A-W-E-S-W-O-M-E.

Enjoy the ride!
